# bargain
an e-bargaining platform

Can be integrated to any e-commerce and people can start bargaining instead of buying things at the quoted price.
Think of it as e-cart which enables cart integration with different e-commerce sites.

What's a bargain?
It's one of those things we Indians grow up learning and doing. When someone tries to sell something, you don't just buy it at the quoted price, you bargain.
You quote a lower price to which the seller can give his counter offer.
This exchange of offer and counter-offer continues till both of you agree on a common price or either of you walkout on the deal.
Negotiating, agreeing and not bying or selling, would get negative points for the buyer or seller.
Hence every buyer/seller will have his account mainatained with the platform.

This platform also serves to become a source of data for analytics like what are the buyer seller trends. What is the pivot point at which the deals are breaking. This will allow the sellers to place their product strategically in the market to achieve a quick sell.
